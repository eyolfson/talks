\frametitle{Goal}

Formulate a grammar for integer arithmetic
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Backus-Naur Form}

BNF is a common way we formulate grammars\\~\\

Given as $G = (T, N, S, P)$, where:

\begin{description}
  \item[$G$] is the grammar
  \item[$T$] is a set of terminals
  \item[$N$] is a set of non-terminals
  \item[$S$] is the starting non-terminal
  \item[$P$] is a set of productions
\end{description}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Terminals}

A \alert{terminal} is usually a \alert{token} from the \alert{lexer}\\~\\

A \alert{token} is a group of characters with a single meaning\\~\\

\begin{beamercolorbox}[sep=1em]{solarizedcolorbox}
  The \alert{lexer} is responsible for enforcing these groupings and stripping
  out white space
\end{beamercolorbox}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Tokens}

There are two types of tokens: simple and compound\\~\\

A \alert{simple token} is usually a single character\\~\\

A \alert{compound token} is defined by a \alert{regular expression}\\~\\

Note that we can query the string which matched a token
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Our Tokens}

Simple: $+, -, *, /$\\~\\

Compound: \lstinline{INT}\\~\\~\\

Therefore, $T = \{ +, -, *, /,$\lstinline{INT}$\}$
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Regular Expression Operations}

Recall a \alert{regular expression} is made up of characters and the following
operators:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cl}
$\cdot$        & sequence (implied)\\
\lstinline{[]} & character sets\\
\lstinline{|}  & alternation (left or right)\\
\lstinline{()} & grouping\\
\lstinline{*}  & repetition (zero or more)\\
\lstinline{+}  & repetition (one or more)\\
\lstinline{?}  & repetition (zero or one)\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The repetition operators apply to the preceding element
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Regular Expression Output}

When we apply a \alert{regular expression} to a string and it will match or
not\\~\\

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\bfseries Regular Expression & \bfseries String &  \bfseries Match\\
\lstinline{aa*}    &                & No\\
\lstinline{a+}     & \lstinline{a}  & Yes\\
\lstinline{a+}     & \lstinline{aa} & Yes\\
\lstinline{(ab)|b} & \lstinline{a}  & No\\
\lstinline{a?b}    & \lstinline{b}  & Yes\\
\lstinline{a?b}    & \lstinline{ab} & Yes\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Formulating an Integer}

Recall, we need to define the \lstinline{INT} \alert{token} (or
\alert{terminal}) for our grammar\\~\\

We would verbally describe it as one or more digits
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Regular Expression for Integers}

We would use the character set \lstinline{[0-9]} to match a single digit\\~\\

Since we want one or more digits, we can apply \lstinline{+} to a digit\\~\\

Giving us the regular expression \lstinline{[0-9]+}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Regular Expression Application}

How do regular expression implementations actually work?\\~\\

One way is to convert the regular expression to a \alert{finite state automaton}
(FSA) and apply the input character by character
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Finite State Automaton}

A FSA contains the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A set of \alert{states} and \alert{state transitions}
  \item A \alert{initial state} and one or more \alert{accepting states}\\~\\
\end{itemize}

\alert{States} are arbitrarily numbered and \alert{state transitions} are for
individual characters
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{FSA Notation}

\begin{fsa}
  \node[state]                                 (sn)               {$s_n$};
  \node[state, initial]                        (s0) [right=of sn] {$s_0$};
  \node[state, accepting, node distance=2.5cm] (s1) [right=of s0] {$s_1$};
  \node[below of=sn] {State $n$};
  \node[below of=s0] {Initial state};
  \node[below of=s1] {Accepting state}; 
\end{fsa}

\alert{State transitions} are represented by labelled arrows
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{FSA Usage}

To match a string with our \alert{regular expression}, do the following:\\~\\

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Begin at the initial state\\~\\
  \item Take the \alert{state transition} matching the current character
    \begin{itemize}
      \item If no transition, string does not match\\~\\
    \end{itemize}
  \item Repeat step 2 for the next character until there are no more\\~\\
  \item Check if we're in an accepting state

    \begin{itemize}
      \item If so, the string does match
      \item Otherwise, string does not match
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

Most regular expression implementations can handle more than the definition of

Can you write a regular expression to match: {\tt a}$^n$ {\tt b}$^n$?

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Practical Regular Expression Answer}

\textbf{Perl Regular Expression}: \lstinline{^(a(?1)?b)$}\\~\\

This solution uses recursion, (\lstinline{?1}) is a reference to the outer group
\\~\\

This expands to the following:

\begin{center}
\lstinline{^(a(?1)?b)$}\\
\lstinline{^(a(a(?1)?b)?b)$}\\
etc $\dots$

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Push Down Automata}

We can change our approach to be able to match \lstinline{(}$^n$ \lstinline{a)}
$^n$\\~\\

We add a stack (a push down stack) and modify our FSA as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Add a transition condition to optionally check the top of the stack 
  \item Allow transitions to push and pop from the stack\\~\\
\end{itemize}

This modified FSA is called a \alert{finite state control}\\~\\

The stack and the FSC together form a \alert{push down automata}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Push Down Automata Notation}

Our transitions are now: character, top of stack, optional push/pop\\~\\

The character can have a special symbol $\varepsilon$ meaning you can take a
transition without a character\\~\\

The top of the stack has two special symbols:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\varepsilon$ means the top of the stack is empty
  \item $\alpha$ means the top of the stack may be anything
\end{itemize}

In other words, $x$ and $y$ are a sequence of terminals and non-terminals\\~\\

We say $x$ derives $y$ in one step ($x \Rightarrow y$) if we can apply a
single \alert{production}~(in~$P$) to $x$ and get $y$\\~\\

We say $x$ derives $y$ ($x \Rightarrow^* y$) if we can apply one or more
\alert{productions}~(in~$P$) to $x$ to get $y$

\frametitle{BNF Single Derivation Question}

If we have the following:\\~\\

$x = e + e$\\
$y = e + e + e$\\~\\

Does $x \Rightarrow y$?

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{BNF Single Derivation Answer}

If we have the following:\\~\\

$x = e + e$\\
$y = e + e + e$\\~\\

$e + e \Rightarrow e + e + e$ because we can apply $e \rightarrow e + e$ (in P)
to $x$ to get to $y$\\~\\

Note that we could replace either $e$

\frametitle{Purpose of a Grammar}

The lexer breaks up the input string into a sequence of \alert{tokens}\\~\\

The grammar should be used to match this sequence if it's valid\\~\\

The sequence is valid if we can derive it from the \alert{starting non-terminal}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Our Grammar (Attempt 2)}

Let's drop multiplication and division for now:\\~\\

\begin{align*}
T &= \{ +, -, \text{\lstinline{INT}} \}\\
N &= \{ e \}\\
S &= e\\
P &= \begin{cases}e \rightarrow e + e \\
     e \rightarrow e - e\\
     e \rightarrow \text{\lstinline{INT}}\end{cases}
\end{align*}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Language Formal Definition}

We have a \alert{grammar}, $G$, and we want to know what's in our
\alert{language}, $L$\\~\\

We define $L(G)$ as the set of all sequences of terminals that can be derived
from the \alert{starting non-terminal}, $S$

\begin{center}
$L(G) = \{ s$ | $S \Rightarrow^* s$ and $s \in T^* \}$ 
\end{center}

Note that $L(G)$ is likely an infinite set (all possible valid input strings)
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{BNF Derivation Question}

Consider the string \lstinline{"1 + 2 + 3"}, is it in $L(G)$?\\~\\

After the lexer, we have the following tokens: \lstinline{INT} $+$
\lstinline{INT} $+$ \lstinline{INT}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{BNF Derivation Answer}

Yes, we can since we can derive \lstinline{INT} $+$ \lstinline{INT} $+$
\lstinline{INT} with the \alert{starting non-terminal}
\begin{align*}
e &\Rightarrow e + e\\
  &\Rightarrow e + e + e\\
  &\Rightarrow e + e + \text{\lstinline{INT}}\\
  &\Rightarrow e + \text{\lstinline{INT}} + \text{\lstinline{INT}}\\
  &\Rightarrow \text{\lstinline{INT}} + \text{\lstinline{INT}} +
               \text{\lstinline{INT}}
\end{align*}

Note that the intermediate stages of our derivation which contain terminals and
non-terminals is called a \alert{sentential form} of $G$

\frametitle{BNF Leftmost Derivation Question}

We can do a \alert{leftmost derivation} by replacing the leftmost non-terminal
in a single step\\~\\

What does our derivation for  \lstinline{INT} $+$ \lstinline{INT} $+$
\lstinline{INT} look like now?

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{BNF Leftmost Derivation Answer (1)}

\begin{align*}
e &\Rightarrow e + e\\
  &\Rightarrow e + e + e\\
  &\Rightarrow \text{\lstinline{INT}} + e + e\\
  &\Rightarrow \text{\lstinline{INT}} + \text{\lstinline{INT}} + e\\
  &\Rightarrow \text{\lstinline{INT}} + \text{\lstinline{INT}} +
               \text{\lstinline{INT}}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Parse Tree}

A \alert{parse tree} is just a visual representation of the derivation\\~\\

The root node is always the \alert{starting non-terminal}\\~\\

The children of any \alert{non-terminal} is the result of applying the
\alert{production}\\~\\

What is the parse tree for the previous derivation?

Can we do a different leftmost derivation?

And the parse tree?
